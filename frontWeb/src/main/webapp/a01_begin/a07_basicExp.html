        Please, don't see<br>
        Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies<br>
        Please, see me<br>
        Reaching out for someone I can't see<br>
        Take my hand<br>
        Let's see where we wake up tomorrow<br>
        Best laid plans<br>
        Sometimes are just a one night stand<br>
        I'll be damned<br>
        Cupid's demanding back his arrow<br>
        So let's get drunk on our tears<br>
        And, God, tell us the reason<br>
        Youth is wasted on the young<br>
        It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run<br>
        Searching for meaning<br>
        But are we all lost stars<br>
        Trying to light up the dark?<br>
        Who are we?<br>
        Just a speck of dust within the galaxy<br>
        Woe is me<br>
        If we're not careful turns into reality<br>
        Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow<br>
        Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer<br>
        Turn the page<br>
        Maybe we'll find a brand new ending<br>
        Where we're dancing in our tears<br>
        And, God, tell us the reason<br>
        Youth is wasted on the young<br>
        It's hunting season<br>
        And the lambs are on the run<br>
        Searching for meaning<br>
        But are we all lost stars<br>
        Trying to light up the dark?<br>
        And I thought I saw you out there crying<br>
        And I thought I heard you call my name<br>
        And I thought I heard you out there crying<br>
        Just the same<br>
        Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>
        God, give us the reason<br>
        Youth is wasted on the young<br>
        It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run<br>
        Searching for meaning<br>
        But are we all lost stars<br>
        Trying to light up the dark?<br>
        And I thought I saw you out there crying<br>
        And I thought I heard you call my name<br>
        And I thought I heard you out there crying<br>
        But are we all lost stars<br>
        Trying to light up the dark?<br>
        But are we all lost stars<br>
        Trying to light up the dark?<br>
