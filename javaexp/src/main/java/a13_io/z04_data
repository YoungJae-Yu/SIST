""always, i'll care"" Lyrics:

always, i’ll care
driving down the interstate
i’ve never felt so far away
leaving hardly hurts at all
i’m sorry that I never call
 
often i get exhausted
trying regardless to be enough
is it selfish, not to be selfless
when all i can help is to open up
 
i’ll be better then i was before
despite every text of yours ignored
will you call me still just to hear my voice
i swear
always, i’ll care
 
flipping through our photographs
these moments never seem to last
listening to self control
there’s feelings that you’ll never know
 
leave me, it’s never easy
i’ve had a lifetime to be alone
if you let me, when it gets heavy
no i’ll never let you be all alone
 
i’ll be better then i was before
despite every text of yours ignored
will you call me still just to hear my voice
i swear
always, 
always,
always, i’ll care
